## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ privacy.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

In our case, the `Layout.astro` file is imported in both `index.astro` and `privacy.astro`, which applies the layout to all these pages (i.e., wraps these pages).

The `Layout.astro` imports the `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro`, and defines page meta attributes (title, description), favicon, etc.

We use the `prose` tailwindcss typography class in `privacy.astro` to make it look nicer to read without applying much styling.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
